This serves as a demo repository to show that async Vue.js components leave behind timeouts for _timeout_ and _delay_ that will fire late after the original component has been rendered.

In a web browser this might not be a severe problem, but when using server side rendering/generating, these will stack up.
When generating pages, the node process will be blocked until the timeouts have completed AFAIK.

When generating pages for Nuxt, this leads to a warning message like this:

-----
The command 'nuxt generate' finished but did not exit after 5s
This is most likely not caused by a bug in Nuxt.js
Make sure to cleanup all timers and listeners you or your plugins/modules start.
Nuxt.js will now force exit

DeprecationWarning: Starting with Nuxt version 3 this will be a fatal error
